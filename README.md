# POO_ComplexNumberCpp
# Object-Oriented Math Operations in C++  

This repository contains an exercise in applying mathematical operations and object-oriented programming (OOP) using C++.  

## Features  

- **Classes Implemented**  
  - `Rational` (for rational numbers)  
  - `Complex` (for complex numbers)  

- **Methods Available in Each Class**  
  - `addition(<type>)`  
  - `subtraction(<type>)`  
  - `multiplication(<type>)`  
  - `division(<type>)` *(only available for Rational class)*  
  - `info(<type>)` *(prints the Rational or Complex object clearly)*  

- **Usage of Setters and Getters**  

- **Arithmetic Operations Between Different Types** (defined in `arithmetic.h`):  
  - Complex and Rational  
  - Complex and Integer  
  - Rational and Integer  


- **Namespace usage { isa }** (defined in `Complex.h & Rationnel.h`):
